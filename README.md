# NotepadADV
A simple rich text formatter with the visuals of Microsoft Notepad.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NotepadADV is a advanced RTF version of Microsoft Notepad which can format text in a RTF format. You can save your files as RTF format and open/create new files whenever you want. 

This is basically a fun project and is no way meant to infringe the copyrights of Microsoft. They did an amazing job developing notepad and without it we wouldn't have been here. I just developed this normal project and gave it the ability to format rich texts. That's it.

**Frequently asked questions:**
- My saved files appear with no extension / Why can't I open my save files?
Ans: While saving, please append file name with `.rtf` so that it can get recognised as rich text format. After that you can use any text editor or NotepadADV to open it.
- The help button is buggy / Bad help :(
Ans: It is, deal with it. I will fix it though :)


Have fun!
